# IPL Score Prediction Model

## Overview
This project predicts the final score of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest regression model. The model uses historical match data, including team statistics, player performances, and match conditions, to provide accurate predictions for IPL match scores.

## Features
- **Score Prediction:** The model predicts the final score based on key match features like overs, wickets, run rate, and player statistics.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.
- **Model Optimization:** The Random Forest model is fine-tuned with hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best prediction accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Key insights and predictions are visualized using plots to understand the model's behavior better.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Model:** Random Forest Regression (from scikit-learn)
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Source:** IPL historical match data (team statistics, player performance, match results)
